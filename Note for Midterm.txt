	Nonvolatile memory: does not lose its content when power is switched off.

	ROM: 
	EEPROM and flash RAM: nonvolatile, slower than RAM, can be rewritten
	CMOS: volatile, Hold current time, date and configuration parameters, use small battery

	Performance: 
		Response time: The time between the start and completion of a task

		Throughput: The total amount of work done in a given time

		If Perf is response time: 
			Perf_x = 1 / ExecutionTime_x 

		CPU ExecutionTime = CPU ClockCycles * ClockCycleTime 

		CPU ExecutionTime = CPU ClockCycles / ClockRate 

		CPU clock cycles = InstructionsForAProgram * CPI

			CPI is the average number of clock cycles that each instruction takes to execute

		CPU ExecutionTime = Instruction count x CPI x Clock cycle time

		CPU Clock cycles = sum(CPI[i] * C[i])
			C[i] is the count of number of instruction of class i . 

		Increases in CPU performance can come from 3 sources: 
			+ ^ clock rate
			+ v CPI via improving processor organization 
			+ Compiler enhancements that lower the instruction count or generate instructions with a lower average CPI

	There are 2 methods to load Constant from register 

	Registers $s0 to $s7 map onto registers 16 to 23
	Registers $t0 to $t7 map onto registers 8 to 15

	R-Type : op rs rt rd shamt funct 
			 6  5  5  5  5     6

	I-Type : op rs rt const/address 
			 6  5  5  16 
			 => immediate or data transfer (cond. branch)

	J-Type : op address 
			 6  26 
			 => uncond. branch 


	Opcode tells the format of the instruction

	j Label 
	jr reg : jump to address in a register 

	jal ProcedureAddress 
		-> jump to the address 
		-> $ra = PC + 4

	caller : calling program 
	callee : be called 

	$gp : access to static data 

	lui : laod upper immediately 

	All conditional branches use PC-relative addressing
